## Description

To dynamically and quickly create a team HTML page, Inquirer NPM was utilized to:

- Generate command-line questions to the user.
- The user input was gathered and added as information to employee templates to create HTML pages.

## Installation

1. Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules? and .DS store. This ensures that the node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub.
2. Use the command-line, npm install, to install Inquirer NPM.
3. Install jest to test the documents.
4. To start answering questions to create the HTML file, use the command, node index.js.

## Usage

- Inquirer NPM is used to prompt the user to provide information regarding their employee teams to create their HTML
  pages.
- fs.writeFile is used to render the HTML.
- Once the user's information regarding:
  - name, id, email, member's role, then subsequent user role questions are served:
  - Manager - office number, Engineer - Github Username, Tester - speciality and Intern - school name.
- An HTML file with the user's reponses regarding their team is created.
